### Premise

 This post is the first of the many for the series on investment valuation. This series will be based on the lessons I've learnt on investment valuation, with each post containing some condensed theory and and techniques to put those theory into practice.

My desire to learn investment valuation is a result of my passion for finance, which I developed during my undergrad years after having read a lot of general and personal finance books.

### Resources

The primary sources that I used to learn valuation are an online course and a book, both created Prof. Aswath Damodaran, who teaches corporate finance and equity valuation at NYU Stern school of business. 
His online course on Investment Valuation is available on youtube and on his personal website for free. And the title of the book referenced is "Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset".

Explore his website since it has got pretty much everything that he has to offer on Valuation and corporate finance. His lectures on Valuation and corporate finance are all archived in his website and a lot important spreadsheet models and data sheets are provided in his website for free.

Now to put the tools and technique into practice I will be performing a case study on an actual company and for this I have chosen an Indian Food and beverage company called Britannia India limited. So throughout this series, Britania will be the company used to test and practice the techniques that I've learnt. The reasons behind my choice for the company are predominantly due to the fact that this is a mature company with a large market capitalization, and its stock constitutes the NIFTY-50.  

To obtain the information for the case study I will be using two sources. First is the internet, from which I will be obtaining information on the industrial sector, the market size, the general economic outlook, and other information relating to the macro-economic and wider view of the industry.
For the company specific information I will be using the annual report of the company.

The link to the company's annual report is given [here](#).

From here on each post will be more of a step-by-step guide to valuing the company, with each post containing few lessons condensed and those principle put into practice. At the end of this journey I aim to gain an intuitive understanding about valuation and develop a structured approach to value a firm, also to have valued the chosen company succesfully.

The index for all the remaining posts in this series is given in this [post](#).
