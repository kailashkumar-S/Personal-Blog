I have written this post to summarise the tutorials and the steps that I followed to build this blog. I will be laying out the steps broadly and will be linking the actual documents for each tool for further reference. 

This blog is built using Jekyll, which is a static website generator, and I have used a pre made Jekyll theme to build my website on top of it. So my blog has not been built from scratch but is rather uses a pre made template. 

### Setting up the local environment

The first step is to build a local environment where we will be building and testing our website in the local server. This means that the website that we build will reside only in our computer and is still not hosted in the internet.

The choice of OS for development is up to yours, but I personally tried building my site in both macOS and Linux and found linux much more convenient as it is easy to resolve dependency issues and errors in the linux environment.

Jekyll is basically built using a programming langauge called Ruby and is available as a ruby gem. To install Jekyll we also have to install the ruby development environment.

The guide to installing a ruby development environment is given [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

After the ruby environment is set up, install Jekyll using the following code.
