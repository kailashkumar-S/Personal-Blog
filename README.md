Hi this is the repository for my personal blog. 

I have built my blog using **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** which is a static website generator for simple blog and personal websites.

The step by step guide to install and use Jekyll can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)

I have built my site on top a pre made theme called **Jekyll Hydeout** and the link to the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout)

If you do like the website that I have made please feel free to fork my project and make changes to the website on top of it.

The website has been hosted using **github pages** and **Netlify**.

Netlify is an all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects and is a simple to use solution for continous integeration and automated deployment. To get started checkout the guide to Netlify [here.] (https://docs.netlify.com/#get-started)
