Hi, I am Kailash. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical engineering, in the year 2019, and I am currently working as an analyst at Deloitte USI, Bengaluru. Even though the field of my study was in engineering, I find my interests in lot of other things. 

As a bookworm, I spent most of my childhood and teens reading books on a variety of subjects and going forward helped me develop a particular interest for finance and writting. This interest influenced me to pursue a career in finance and to write blogs as a hobby. This blog has been an attempt by me to bring the two things that I love together. My writtings will primarily focus on lessons that I've learnt in finance, but occasionally also on things that I find interesting.

I also love to read and engage in ~~discussions~~ memes on philosophy. I have been influenced by the works of Nietzsche, Marcus Aurelius and Albert Camus to name a few but have developed a specific liking for stoicism.

A huge manchester united fan and also a music junkie (Will go crazy for Kanye west, Arctic monkeys and Tame Impala). I enjoy watching cartoons and anime at my leisure. Naruto and adventure time are few of my all time favourites.
