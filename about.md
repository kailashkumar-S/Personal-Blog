Hi, I am kailash. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical engineering in the year 2019 and I am currently working as an analyst at Deloitte USI, Bengaluru. Even though the field of my study was in engineering, I find my interests in lot of other things. 

As a bookworm, I spent most of my childhood and teens reading lot of books in variety of subjects and thus helped me discover a significant interest in finance and writting, out of which I chose to pursue the former as my profession and the latter as my passion. Hence this blog has been an attempt by me to bring the two thing that I love, together. I started this blog to write about things that I learn in finance and sort of maintain this as a journal of the lessons I pick along the way.

I also love to read and engage in ~~discussions~~ memeing about philosophy. Few of my favourite philosophers are Nietzsche, Marcus Aurelius and Albert Camus.

Other than reading I also love to watch football[A huge manchester United fan] and listening to a lot of songs. Few of my favorite artists include Tame Impala, Kanye west, Arctic monkeys. I also a big fan of cartoons and anime. Naruto and adventure time are few of my all time favourites.
