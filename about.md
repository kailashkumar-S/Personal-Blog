Hi there, I am kailash. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical engineering in the year 2019 and I am currently working as an analyst in Deloitte USI, Bengaluru. Like many people even though the field of study that I pursued might have been in engineering,my interests are set on lot of things other than engineering . 

Growing up as a bookworm, helped me discover and develop significant interest in finance and writting, out of which I chose to pursue the former as my profession and the latter as my passion. Hence I started this blog as an attempt to bring the two thing that I love.

Other than my primary interests, I have a significant interest to read and engage in ~~discussions~~ memeing about philosophy. My favourites include Nietzsche, Marcus Aurelius and Albert Camus.

A huge fan of Manchester United, Tame Impala, Kanye west, Arctic monkeys and love binge-watching Naruto and adventure time (because being 13 again is bloobalooby!).
