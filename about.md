Hi, I am kailash. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical engineering, in the year 2019, and I am currently working as an analyst at Deloitte USI, Bengaluru. Even though the field of my study was in engineering, I find my interests in lot of other things. 

Being a bookworm, I spent most of my childhood and teens reading books on a variety of subjects and this helped me discover my interest for finance and writting, out of which I chose to pursue the former as my profession and the latter as my passion. This blog has been an attempt by me to bring the two thing that I love, together. My writtings will be mainly focused on things and lessons that I learn in finance and occasionally on things that I feel is useful information to others.

I also love to read and engage in ~~discussions~~ memes about philosophy. I have read works of Nietzsche, Marcus Aurelius and Albert Camus to name a few. And have developed a great liking for stoicism.

I also love watching football[A huge manchester United fan] and spend pretty much most of the day listening to songs. I enjoy watching cartoons and anime at my leisure. Naruto and adventure time are few of my all time favourites.
