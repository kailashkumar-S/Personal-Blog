Hi, I am kailash. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical engineering, in the year 2019, and I am currently working as an analyst at Deloitte USI, Bengaluru. Even though the field of my study was in engineering, I find my interests in lot of other things. 

Being a bookworm, I spent most of my childhood and teens reading books on a variety of subjects and this helped me develop an interest for finance and writting. Later on I decided to pursue my profession in finance and the writting as a passion. This blog has been an attempt by me to bring the two thing that I love together. My writtings will focus on the lessons that I've learnt in finance and occasionally on things that I feel is an useful and interesting information to others.

I also love to read and engage in ~~discussions~~ memes about philosophy. I have read the works of Nietzsche, Marcus Aurelius and Albert Camus to name a few and have developed a great liking for stoicism.

I am a huge manchester united fan and spend pretty much most part of my day listening to songs. I enjoy watching cartoons and anime at my leisure. Naruto and adventure time are few of my all time favourites.
